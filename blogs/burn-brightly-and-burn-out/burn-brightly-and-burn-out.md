<div class="text-sm dark:text-white">At its peak on January 3rd 2000, Yahoo’s stocks closed at a staggering $475 per share, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company. A year later in 2001 on September 26th, the price per share was at an all time low of $8.11. In the mid-1990s Netscape had a market share of over 90%, which quickly became less than 1% by 2006. In July of 2005, Myspace was acquired by News Corporation for $580 million by 2008 it had over a hundred million monthly active users. By 2019 there were only seven million.</div>

<div class="text-sm dark:text-white">
These bizarre rapid ups and downs are not limited to the example companies above. The whole software industry is brimming with such examples. Google just made a better search engine to counter yahoo. Gmail was just simply better than hotmail. Edge, chrome and firefox simply made better browsers than netscape. The internet is an amazing place, news travels fast, and unlike an inertia like customer behavior for physical products, software products can be very downloaded and tested often with easy to use trial periods where the user doesn’t have to pay. This makes the whole software industry very disruptive.</div>

<div class="text-sm dark:text-white">
It took Tiktok just nine months after its global launch to reach 100 million users compared to instagram’s 2.5 years. OpenAI’s ChatGPT took just 2 months. There were no million dollar ad campaigns for ChatGPT, it’s just that it is a really good product available very quickly and for very little cost. Anecdotally, most software engineers I know have reduced their google searches by over 70%. In 2023 google’s search product generated a revenue of almost 57%. Google’s two decade long majority share in navigating information on the internet is finally getting disrupted. </div>

The candlewick of the tech companies burns brightly, but it also burns quickly.</div>
