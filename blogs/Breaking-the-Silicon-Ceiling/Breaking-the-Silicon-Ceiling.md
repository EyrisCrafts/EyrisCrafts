<div class="text-sm dark:text-white">In the relentless race to dominate the AI landscape, tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and OpenAI have collectively funneled billions into acquiring cutting-edge hardware, particularly GPUs, to support their AI ambitions. In 2023, Google's capital expenditures saw a significant uptick, with the company maintaining a GPU fleet estimated to be two to three times larger than its TPU fleet, as part of its broader AI strategy​ (The Next Platform)​​ (markets.businessinsider.com)​. Amazon's AWS mirrored this trend, with AI-driven investments contributing to a projected 22% increase in cloud-related capital expenditures for 2024, following a 20% rise to $84 billion in 2022​ (markets.businessinsider.com)​​ (SP Global)​.

Microsoft's aggressive investment in AI infrastructure saw a 55% year-over-year growth in 2023, with continued increases expected as it integrates OpenAI's technologies​ (SP Global)​. Meta, focusing on enhancing its data center capabilities, plans to spend around $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024​ (markets.businessinsider.com)​. While Apple's specific figures remain less detailed, the company's substantial investments in custom silicon and AI hardware underline its commitment to staying at the forefront of AI innovation. Meanwhile, OpenAI leverages significant GPU investments through its partnership with Microsoft Azure to sustain its advanced AI model development and deployment efforts. This massive expenditure underscores the critical role hardware plays in the AI arms race, even as innovations in software and model efficiency emerge as pivotal factors for future advancements.</div>

However, the fundamental issues with the technology still remain, ChatGPT and other transformer models still hallucinate. Image generative models still end up generating images with fragments of their training data which ends up being a copyright issue. This is not to undermine the the increase in investments in the field of AI, which, unlike it's predecessor buzzword Blockchain, actually has uses. What should be done however, is the investment in more human resource for AI and not just GPUs.</div>

The time is ripe to go beyond silicon and towards opportunities for talented to-be AI researchers.</div>
